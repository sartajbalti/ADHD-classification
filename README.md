# ADHD-classification
This is the code of my paper Functional connectivity based Classification of ADHD Using HELM.

flod5data is our data; I have already segement it into 5-flod for the 5-fold-crossvalidation.

HK_helm_train_1h.m is the code for khelm only one layer. i have write 4 scrips for one layer to four layer you can add more layer to record the result.

It help you rewrite the file main2_k.m and main1_hk_1h.m. The first one is the experient for keml, and the
 second one is for hkelm with one layer.

If you need any help regarding the implimentaion reach me at s2140019@edu.cc.ac.jp
